# Pixscalling

3rd Semester project aiming to apply Pixel Scalling filters on images or any other sources!

An interface can be found in the [Pixscalling Interface](https://github.com/Appixroid/PixscallingInterface) repository.

## Compilation

### Linux

use `make` in the project folder to compile all the necessary files in one "pixscalling" executable file.

### Window

No support for now...

## Usage

Launch the pixscalling (`./pixscalling <options -s -m> [In file] [Out file]Â [Filter] [Iteration]`) executable file of the project root folder to transform the file "in.png / .jpg ..." in a file called "out.png / .jpg ...". (Depends of *convert*).

## Available filters

- [X] scale (No filter just size up)
- [X] epx
- [X] scale2x
- [X] scale3x
- [X] eagle
- [ ] supereagle
